# criminal_traits_profiling
 In the context of criminal behavior, there are discernible traits that are more prevalent in individuals who exhibit criminal tendencies compared to those who do not. To unravel the complex relationships between these traits and criminality, data analysis techniques such as K-means clustering are often employed. K-means clustering is a machine learning algorithm that partitions a given dataset into a predetermined number of clusters, with each cluster representing a distinct pattern or grouping of data points based on their similarities in trait values. By applying K-means clustering to a dataset of trait values, patterns and associations can be uncovered, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying factors contributing to criminal behavior.
